      <h3>About DHART</h3>
      <p>
        Multi-omics data have become the workhorse of cardiac research, but their accessibility and usability remain a critical issue.
        The Digital HeART (DHART) Research portal is a digital platform for exploration and analysis of cardiac multi-omics, with an 
        emphasis on single-cell data. Our aim is to enable researchers with limited access to high dimensional data, insufficient 
        resources or minimal knowledge of bioinformatics to benefit from the evergrowing amount of cardiac omics. 
        The portal, currently under development, builds on the <a href='https://umgear.org'>gEAR</a> framework.
